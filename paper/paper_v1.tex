\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ultrafast spectroscopy
	\item Collective modes in superconductors: Higgs, Goldstone (shifted to plasma energy due to Anderson-Higgs)
	\item In two-band superconductors: Additional out-of-phase Leggett mode, can couple to Higgs in nonequilibrium
	\item Difficulties excitation Higgs mode, in clean-limit only weak coupling
	\item In dirty superconductors: Coupling is enhanced
	\item This work: 1) Higgs oscillations in two-band sc. with bands in different limits, 2) Nonequilibrium optical conductivity, 3) Leggett mode in dirty-limit, 4) Prediction for MgB$_2$
\end{itemize}







%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Model}
\label{sec:model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
	\item In this section show only the final formula, all derivation into the appendix A as the equations are similar to the Murotani paper.
	\item Show Hamiltonian, gap equation, Mattis-Bardeen replacement, general approach for calculating time evolution...
	\item I suggest putting the (final) equations for current, optical conductivity, $\delta\Delta(t)$ into the respective section, but in principle we could also put all equations in this section and show only the results in the following sections

	\item Used parameters (take general parameters for section III and IV where no Leggett mode occurs, Leggett mode is discussed later separately and MgB$_2$ will be also discussed later. Show the used parameters in these section)
	\item Implementation details? Are there any subtle points?
\end{itemize}


\begin{eqnarray}
	H_{\text{BCS}} = \sum_{i\mathbf{k}\sigma}  
	\varepsilon_{i\mathbf{k}}c_{i\mathbf{k}\sigma}^\dagger
	c_{i\mathbf{k}\sigma} + \sum_{i\mathbf{k}}^{}
	\left( \Delta_i c_{i\mathbf{-k}\uparrow }^\dagger
	c_{i\mathbf{k}\downarrow }^\dagger  \right) \,,
\end{eqnarray}

where $\varepsilon_{i\mathbf{k}} = s_i \left(\mathbf{k}^2/2m_i -
\varepsilon_{F_i}\right)$ and the superconducting order parameter is self-consistently determined by 
$\Delta_i = \sum_{j\mathbf{k}}^{}U_{ij} \langle c_{j-\mathbf{k}\downarrow
}c_{j\mathbf{k}\uparrow }\rangle$.

\begin{eqnarray*}
	H_{\text{p-p}} = -\sum_{i\mathbf{kk'}\sigma}^{}
	\mathbf{J}_{i\mathbf{kk'}} \cdot \mathbf{A} \,
	c_{i\mathbf{k}\sigma}^\dagger  c_{i\mathbf{k}'\sigma} +
	\sum_{i\mathbf{k}\sigma}^{} \frac{s_i e^2}{2m_i} \mathbf{A}^2 \,
	c_{i\mathbf{k}\sigma}^\dagger c_{i\mathbf{k}\sigma}
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
	\langle \left|\mathbf{e} \cdot
	\mathbf{J}_{i\mathbf{kk'}}\right|^2\rangle_{\text{Av}}
	&=& \int \frac{d\Omega_\mathbf{k}}{4\pi} \frac{d\Omega_\mathbf{k}'}{4\pi}
	\left|\mathbf{e} \cdot \mathbf{J}_{i\mathbf{kk'}}\right|^2
	\\
	&\approx& \frac{(e v_{F_i})^2}{3 \pi N_i(0)} 
	\frac{\gamma_i}{(\varepsilon-\varepsilon')^2 + \gamma_i^2}
\end{eqnarray*}

Discussion of $A, A^2$.

The full Hamiltonian is given by $H = H_{BCS} + H_{p-p}$.
